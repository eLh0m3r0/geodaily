                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>China's president explicitly vowed reunification following major military exercises near Taiwan, escalating rhetoric and demonstrating capability. Taiwan responded with defense pledges. This represents the most direct confrontation signal in the Taiwan Strait, with implications for US-China relations and regional stability affecting 23 million people and critical semiconductor supply chains.</p>

                                <p>The timing coordination between Xi's speech and military drills suggests deliberate strategic messaging. The exercises tested specific tactics (cheap rockets to exhaust defenses) rather than general capability display, indicating operational planning for potential conflict scenarios.</p>

                                <p>Zelensky claims peace agreement is 90% ready while simultaneously warning against weak deals, creating ambiguity about negotiation status. Putin demands victory, suggesting fundamental disagreement on terms. This represents critical juncture in 4-year conflict affecting European security architecture, NATO expansion, and post-war territorial arrangements affecting 40+ million people.</p>

                                <p>The '90% ready' claim may reflect negotiating posture rather than actual progress. Zelensky's simultaneous rejection of weak deals suggests core issues (territorial control, security guarantees, NATO membership) remain fundamentally unresolved despite apparent numerical progress.</p>

                                <p>US approved TSMC's annual license for Chinese chip manufacturing despite broader tech restrictions, signaling selective engagement. Simultaneously, China is systematically isolating India through regional partnerships and military alliances.

                                <p>The TSMC license suggests US pragmatism on semiconductor supply chains despite rhetoric.
