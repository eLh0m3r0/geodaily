                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Ukrainian President Zelensky meets Trump to finalize a 20-point peace proposal amid Russian military escalation. This diplomatic breakthrough could reshape the nearly four-year conflict, with Trump's support potentially forcing Russia to negotiate or face renewed U.S. military commitment. The outcome affects global security architecture.</p>

                                <p>Russia's timing of massive drone attacks on Kyiv suggests Moscow is testing Trump's resolve and attempting to influence negotiations through military pressure. The coordination between Putin's escalation and the talks reveals strategic calculation beyond simple military objectives.</p>

                                <p>Trump will likely demand Russian concessions on territorial control. If negotiations fail, expect either renewed U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine or a frozen conflict with NATO troops potentially deployed as...</p>

                                <p>Myanmar's military junta holds first elections since 2021 coup amid ongoing civil war, with China as the decisive power broker. Beijing prioritizes stability over democracy, effectively controlling Myanmar's political trajectory. This consolidates Chinese influence in Southeast Asia and demonstrates Beijing's ability to shape regional outcomes independent of Western pressure.</p>

                                <p>The election's legitimacy is irrelevant to China's strategic calculus. Beijing's real objective is preventing state collapse that could destabilize its borders and Belt and Road investments. The junta's military consolidation serves Chinese interests more than democratic restoration.</p>

                                <p>Pakistan-China JF-17 warplane sales to Libya signal Beijing's expansion into North Africa, while Chinese analysts warn Japan could weaponize nuclear technology within 3 years.

                                <p>Putin explicitly warns Ukraine will face military defeat if rejecting peace talks, while simultaneously launching massive attacks on Kyiv. This signals Russia's negotiating position: accept territorial losses or face continued warfare. The statement clarifies Moscow's red lines ahead of Trump-Zelensky talks and suggests Russia may reject any compromise.</p>

                                <p>Putin's timing of this warning—immediately before Zelensky-Trump talks—is deliberate psychological pressure. Russia is signaling to Trump that Ukraine cannot deliver what Moscow demands, making negotiations futile unless Trump pressures Zelensky into capitulation on territorial concessions.</p>
