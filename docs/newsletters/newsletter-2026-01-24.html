                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>First trilateral negotiations since 2022 invasion mark potential diplomatic breakthrough under Trump administration. Territory disputes in Donbas remain central sticking point. Simultaneous Russian air strikes underscore military pressure tactics. Outcome could reshape European security architecture and determine war's trajectory.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media focuses on negotiation optics but underestimates Russia's maximalist territorial demands and Ukraine's domestic political constraints. US leverage and Trump's actual commitment to sustained engagement remain unclear. Potential for talks to collapse without substantive progress.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Talks likely conclude without breakthrough agreement. Russia maintains territorial maximalism while Ukraine resists concessions. Process continues but fundamental positions unchanged. Conflict persists at current intensity.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>New START treaty—cornerstone of nuclear stability since 2010—approaching collapse as Russia suspends inspections and US-Russia relations deteriorate. Expiration would end half-century of nuclear arms control agreements. Risks uncontrolled nuclear arsenal expansion and destabilizes strategic balance between superpowers.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Analysis underestimates cascading effects on non-proliferation regime and emerging nuclear powers' calculations. China's nuclear expansion accelerates without bilateral US-Russia constraints. Domestic political pressures in both countries make renewal difficult despite mutual interest in stability.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Treaty likely expires without renewal. Both sides pursue unilateral nuclear modernization. Triggers secondary arms race among regional powers. Strategic instability increases significantly within 18 months.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>China controls global drone supply chains critical to both Russian and Ukrainian military operations. Civilian technology has become indispensable to modern warfare. Reveals new form of geopolitical power through supply chain dominance rather than direct military capability. Demonstrates China's strategic leverage without direct involvement.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Western analysis focuses on DJI restrictions but misses broader pattern: China's control of critical civilian technologies translates to military leverage. US tariffs and export controls insufficient to break dependency. China's ability to influence conflict outcomes through supply decisions remains underappreciated.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>US accelerates domestic drone manufacturing and supply chain diversification. China leverages supply control for diplomatic concessions. Conflict duration partially determined by drone availability and Chinese export decisions.</p>

                                <p>Pentagon's 2026 National Defense Strategy prioritizes homeland defense and China deterrence while reducing allied support. EU militarizes Arctic in response to Russian and US strategic competition. Arctic becomes new geopolitical flashpoint with territorial, resource, and strategic implications. NATO cohesion tested as US reduces commitment.</p>

                                <p>Shift signals fundamental reorientation of US security posture away from European alliance maintenance. Arctic militarization creates new flashpoint with Russia, China, and indigenous peoples. Canada's Arctic defense capabilities inadequate for emerging threats.
