                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>US envoys delivered a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to accept a 28-point peace plan heavily favoring Russian demands. This represents a critical diplomatic inflection point where Washington is pressuring Kyiv to capitulate, potentially reshaping European security architecture and NATO's future role in Eastern Europe.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The internal US government discord—with Secretary of State Rubio distancing himself from the plan—suggests Trump administration divisions on Ukraine policy. This weakness could embolden Russia to harden negotiating positions rather than compromise.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>Ukraine will likely reject the plan as-is, triggering either escalated US pressure or a diplomatic breakdown. European allies may move toward independent Ukraine support mechanisms, fracturing Western unity.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Trump's first-ever G20 boycott while simultaneously pushing Ukraine terms reveals US withdrawal from multilateral consensus-building. South Africa and China secured backing despite US absence, demonstrating emerging alternative power centers and the decline of Western-led global governance structures.</p>

                                <p>The symbolic significance of US absence during a critical geopolitical moment. This isn't just about Ukraine—it signals Trump's rejection of G20 legitimacy itself, potentially accelerating formation of competing economic blocs and institutions outside Western frameworks.</p>

                                <p>G20 will likely splinter into competing coalitions. BRICS+ mechanisms will strengthen as alternative forums. Western-led institutions face legitimacy crisis and potential institutional reform or replacement.</p>

                                <p>China's military modernization—stealth fighters, aircraft carriers, pilot program innovations—accelerates amid South Korea's nuclear submarine acquisition from US.

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Saturday's deadliest day since ceasefire began, with 21+ Palestinians killed and mutual ceasefire violation accusations, signals imminent breakdown of fragile US-brokered truce. This threatens regional destabilization, potential Hezbollah escalation, and undermines Trump administration's Middle East diplomatic credibility.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The ceasefire was already structurally fragile with competing interpretations of terms. Saturday's escalation may represent deliberate testing of commitment levels rather than accidental violations, suggesting calculated moves toward renewed conflict rather than temporary friction.</p>

                                <p>Ceasefire will likely collapse within weeks. Full-scale Gaza conflict resumes. Regional actors (Hezbollah, Houthis) will escalate. US diplomatic leverage in Middle East severely damaged, complicating broader regional strategy.</p>
