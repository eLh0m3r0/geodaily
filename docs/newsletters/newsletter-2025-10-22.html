                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>The postponement of Trump's planned summit with Putin represents a critical diplomatic failure that undermines Trump's central campaign promise to quickly end the Ukraine war. Putin's rejection of ceasefire terms and Trump's reluctance to meet signals deepening impasse, with major implications for US-Russia relations and European security architecture.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media focus on Trump's rhetoric obscures the substantive disagreement: Putin demands territorial concessions while Europe/Ukraine propose frozen conflict without land loss. This fundamental incompatibility suggests military escalation may continue regardless of diplomatic efforts.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Expect intensified military operations on both sides as diplomatic channels cool. Trump may pivot toward punitive measures against Russia or alternatively pressure Ukraine to concede territory, fracturing the NATO alliance.</p>

                                <p>China's expansion of rare earth export restrictions represents a fundamental shift from trade disputes to strategic resource weaponization. Combined with Trump's tariff threats and currency swap discussions between China-Japan-Korea, this signals a bifurcating global economy with serious implications for technology, defense, and energy sectors worldwide.</p>

                                <p>The currency swap initiative reveals China's sophisticated counter-strategy: building alternative financial infrastructure while the US focuses on tariffs. This structural challenge to dollar dominance receives minimal Western media attention despite long-term systemic implications.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Ukraine's successful strikes on Russian energy infrastructure expose critical vulnerabilities in Putin's war machine. Atlantic Council and Foreign Affairs analyses indicate Russia's economy is far more fragile than Moscow projects, with cascading effects on military production, civilian morale, and long-term sustainability of the conflict.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Western analysis often assumes Russian economic resilience. These reports suggest the opposite: targeted energy attacks create multiplier effects disrupting both military-industrial capacity and civilian infrastructure simultaneously, potentially accelerating economic deterioration faster than sanctions alone.</p>

                                <p>Russia will likely increase attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in retaliation, creating humanitarian crisis. Economic pressure may force difficult choices between military spending and domestic stability, potentially influencing Putin's negotiating...</p>

                                <p>Iran's coordinated opposition with Russia and China to restore nuclear sanctions, combined with Poland's public criticism of Iranian drone sales to Russia, reveals Iran's diplomatic isolation. Simultaneous energy crisis forcing shift to solar power indicates economic deterioration, reducing Iran's regional leverage and increasing unpredictability in Middle East.</p>

                                <p>Iran's deepening isolation paradoxically strengthens its Russia-China alignment while weakening its European negotiating position. The energy crisis suggests internal instability that could affect regional proxy activities and nuclear negotiations more than external pressure alone.</p>
