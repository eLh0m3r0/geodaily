                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>China's transition from minimal deterrent to hair-trigger nuclear posture with rapid silo buildup and launch-on-warning capabilities fundamentally alters strategic stability. This represents the most significant shift in nuclear doctrine in decades, with implications for Taiwan contingencies and US-China relations.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The connection between nuclear posture changes and conventional military readiness around Taiwan. China's nuclear modernization enables more aggressive conventional operations by reducing escalation risks.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>Increased US-China military incidents likely as both sides test new doctrinal boundaries. Nuclear signaling will become more prominent in Taiwan crisis communications within 6 months.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Multi-day live-fire exercises simulating maritime blockade represent operational testing of Taiwan invasion scenarios. Combined with US arms sales and Japan's intervention statements, this demonstrates China moving from deterrence signaling to capability demonstration with immediate military implications.</p>

                                <p>China's threat to physically intercept US arms shipments via coastguard actions. This escalates beyond military drills to potential interdiction operations that could trigger direct US-China military confrontation.</p>

                                <p>US Navy escorts of Taiwan-bound arms shipments likely within 90 days. China may conduct similar drills quarterly, normalizing blockade operations and increasing accident risk.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Zelensky's Mar-a-Lago meeting with Trump and requests for 50-year security guarantees indicate serious peace negotiations. Trump's claims of progress, combined with Russian-Ukrainian accusations over Putin residence attack, suggest talks are at inflection point where military outcomes could shift dramatically.</p>

                                <p>The security guarantee framework debate overshadows territorial concession discussions. Ukraine may be forced to accept unfavorable borders in exchange for long-term NATO-style guarantees, fundamentally altering post-war European security architecture.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Peace framework announcement likely within 60 days. Territorial settlements will favor Russia more than Ukraine publicly admits, triggering domestic Ukrainian political crisis.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Control of Europe's largest nuclear plant remains unresolved in Ukraine peace negotiations despite being critical to both military strategy and civilian safety. Proximity to front lines creates ongoing catastrophic risk. Resolution of this issue will determine viability of any sustainable peace agreement.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The IAEA's limited access and verification capabilities. International nuclear safety frameworks are inadequate for conflict zones, meaning any peace deal lacks enforcement mechanisms for nuclear facility protection.</p>

                                <p>Zaporizhzhia demilitarization clause will be included in peace framework but with weak enforcement. Risk of future disputes over facility control remains high, potentially reigniting conflict.</p>
