                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>China conducted live-fire drills near Taiwan with PLA drones approaching Taipei's center, while the US approved an $11bn arms package and urged dialogue. This represents a critical flashpoint in great power competition with direct implications for regional stability and US-China relations heading into 2026.</p>

                                <p>The strategic timing of these drills—occurring just before planned US-China state visits—suggests Beijing is testing Washington's resolve while attempting to manage diplomatic channels, indicating a calculated escalation rather than spontaneous military posturing.</p>

                                <p>North Korea's Kim Jong-un explicitly praised troops fighting in Ukraine and emphasized deepening military cooperation with Russia in his New Year message. This signals sustained North Korean involvement in the Ukraine conflict and represents a significant realignment of the global security architecture with implications for Northeast Asia and beyond.</p>

                                <p>The emphasis on sustaining cooperation 'into 2026' suggests this is not temporary wartime expedience but a strategic pivot toward a permanent Russia-North Korea axis, potentially including technology transfer and military modernization that could destabilize the Korean Peninsula.</p>

                                <p>A New Year's Eve drone strike killed 24 civilians in Russian-occupied Kherson, with Russia claiming it targeted civilians while Ukraine denies responsibility. The CIA concluded Ukraine did not target Putin's residence, yet tensions remain high despite diplomatic progress, revealing the fragility of peace negotiations and ongoing military escalation.</p>

                                <p>The pattern of mutual accusations and false-flag allegations suggests both sides are using military actions to strengthen negotiating positions rather than pursue genuine de-escalation, indicating peace talks may be performative while actual conflict intensifies.</p>

                                <p>China announced a major tariff reduction on 935 items and analysts highlight that market power, technological innovation, and institutional leverage now matter more than military might.
