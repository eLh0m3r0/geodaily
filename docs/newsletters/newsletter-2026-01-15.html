                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Trump administration threatens military intervention in Iran amid mass protests and imminent executions. This represents a dramatic escalation in US-Iran tensions with potential for direct military conflict. The situation involves nuclear program concerns, internal repression, and US credibility on human rights, creating multiple flashpoints for regional destabilization.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media focus on protest executions obscures deeper strategic calculation: Israel's Netanyahu lobbying for Iran nuclear strikes, Russia's counter-support for Iranian repression, and how US intervention could unite fractured Iranian opposition behind the regime while destabilizing Gulf oil markets.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Trump likely uses execution threats as leverage for negotiations rather than direct strikes. However, miscalculation risk remains high. Regional allies (Saudi Arabia, UAE) will hedge bets. Oil prices could spike...</p>

                                <p>Trump's renewed push to acquire Greenland via military threats, tariffs, and cash offers has triggered unprecedented NATO response. France and Germany deploying troops to Greenland at Denmark's request marks first direct European military counter to Trump doctrine. This challenges post-WWII alliance structure and Arctic geopolitics.</p>

                                <p>Greenland dispute masks deeper issue: Arctic resource competition with Russia and China. Trump's approach alienates Denmark (NATO member) and Scandinavian allies precisely when Arctic militarization accelerates. European military autonomy from US is accelerating, not decelerating, due to Trump's coercive tactics.</p>

                                <p>Greenland remains Danish but becomes heavily militarized. European defense spending accelerates independent of NATO. Trump likely pivots to economic coercion (tariffs on Denmark). Arctic becomes new Cold War frontier with...</p>

                                <p>Ukraine faces severe energy emergency with temperatures at -19°C, widespread blackouts, and no water access. Russian strikes systematically targeting energy infrastructure create humanitarian crisis.

                                <p>Energy crisis is strategic weapon: Russia deliberately targets civilian infrastructure to force Ukrainian capitulation through suffering rather than military defeat.
