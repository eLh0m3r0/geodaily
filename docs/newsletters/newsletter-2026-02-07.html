                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>The expiration of New START on February 4 removes the last bilateral nuclear constraint between US and Russia. With no negotiations underway and Trump dismissing renewal, this marks a critical inflection point in strategic stability. The absence of verification mechanisms creates unpredictable escalation risks affecting global security architecture.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media focus on Trump's rhetoric obscures the technical vacuum: no monitoring of warhead deployments, no notification requirements, and no crisis communication channels. This institutional collapse matters more than political posturing.</p>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>Both powers will accelerate modernization programs within 6-12 months. China will exploit the vacuum to expand arsenals without transparency. Secondary nuclear powers may pursue weapons programs citing instability.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Indirect negotiations in Oman represent first formal diplomatic contact since Trump's military strikes. High-stakes talks occur with massive US military presence in region, creating dual-track diplomacy-coercion dynamic. Failure could trigger military escalation affecting global oil markets and regional stability across Middle East.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media reports 'positive atmosphere' but glosses over structural incompatibility: Trump administration simultaneously pursuing sanctions while negotiating. Iran's economic crisis limits flexibility. Talks may be diplomatic theater masking military preparations.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Negotiations will stall within 2-3 weeks over verification demands. Trump will use stalled talks to justify military action. Regional allies will position for conflict scenario by March.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>US accusation of Chinese secret 2020 nuclear test, coupled with simultaneous arms treaty proposals, reveals fundamental trust deficit. Neither country ratified 1996 test ban treaty. This contradiction exposes why New START collapse matters: verification impossible without baseline honesty. Affects trilateral US-China-Russia stability calculations.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Independent monitors found no evidence supporting US claims, yet US persists with accusations. This suggests intelligence agencies driving policy rather than verified facts. Pattern indicates deteriorating diplomatic norms where unproven allegations become negotiating tactics.</p>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>China will reject US treaty proposals citing hypocrisy. US will escalate accusations to justify military spending increases. Verification becomes impossible; arms race accelerates by default.</p>

                                <p>Tariff reduction from 25% to 18% signals Trump administration prioritizing India as China counterweight. Deal has geopolitical implications beyond economics: India forced to cease Russian crude imports, demonstrating US leverage over strategic partners. Reshapes India-China-US triangle with long-term consequences for Asian supply chains and alliances.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Modi's 'great news' framing masks India's strategic concessions. Ceasing Russian oil imports costs India economically while benefiting US energy interests. Deal represents transactional diplomacy where India gains market access but loses energy independence and Russia relationship flexibility.</p>

                                <p>India will gradually reduce Russian energy dependence over 18 months. China will accelerate India-Pakistan tensions to distract from US alignment. BRICS cohesion weakens as India tilts toward US orbit.</p>
