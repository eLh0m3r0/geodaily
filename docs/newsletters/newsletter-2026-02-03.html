                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Draghi's warning that the current world order is 'dead' signals Europe must urgently unify on defense and foreign policy. Combined with critical mineral dependency on China and the need for strategic autonomy, Europe faces an existential challenge to its geopolitical independence and economic security.</p>

                                <p>The interconnection between energy security, critical minerals, and defense autonomy. Europe cannot achieve strategic independence without solving its supply chain vulnerabilities simultaneously across all three domains.</p>

                                <p>EU will accelerate defense spending and critical mineral sourcing initiatives, potentially leading to new trade agreements with Africa and Central Asia to reduce China dependency within 12-18 months.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Iran's President Pezeshkian has ordered nuclear talks with the US while Trump threatens military action and builds up forces in the Middle East. This represents a critical diplomatic window that could prevent regional war, with implications for global oil markets, regional stability, and US-Iran relations.</p>

                                <p>Russia's potential mediation role and how it benefits from prolonged Iran-US tensions. The timing of diplomatic overtures coinciding with Russian pressure suggests a three-way strategic calculation that Western analysis often misses.</p>

                                <p>Nuclear negotiations will advance over next 60 days, but military incidents could derail talks. A framework agreement is possible by Q2 2026 if Trump administration prioritizes diplomacy over confrontation.</p>

                                <p>Ukraine and Western allies are negotiating a multi-tier ceasefire enforcement plan involving European and US forces.

                                <p>Xi Jinping's removal of top general Zhang Youxia on corruption and nuclear secrets charges indicates major internal power struggles within China's military.
