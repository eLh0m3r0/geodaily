                                <p>Survey of 400+ geopolitical forecasters reveals China could surpass US economically within a decade while still attempting military takeover of Taiwan. This challenges assumptions that economic interdependence prevents conflict and signals highest-risk scenario for global stability.</p>

                                <p>The disconnect between economic power and military adventurism suggests Beijing may view economic dominance as enabling rather than constraining military action, fundamentally altering cost-benefit calculations for Taiwan intervention.</p>

                                <p>Expect accelerated US military aid to Taiwan, regional arms race intensification, and potential NATO-Pacific security linkages as Western powers prepare for simultaneous great power competition across multiple theaters.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Norway's defense chief warns of potential Russian invasion to protect nuclear assets while UK doubles troops in Norway to 2,000.

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Arctic militarization reflects climate change opening new strategic corridors and resource competition, not just Cold War nostalgia. Russia's nuclear asset protection rationale could justify further territorial claims across Arctic regions.</p>

                                <p>China instructing state banks to reduce US Treasury holdings while simultaneously warning Trump administration signals financial coercion strategy.

                                <p>Timing coordination between Treasury reduction announcement and Trump negotiations suggests deliberate signaling rather than market-driven decision. Could trigger broader dollar destabilization if other nations follow China's lead in diversification.</p>

                                <p>Netanyahu rushing to Washington to pressure Trump on Iran missiles while Ukraine faces May 15 deadline for elections and peace vote reveals Trump administration managing multiple simultaneous conflicts.
