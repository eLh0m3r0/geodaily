                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>The extradition of Maduro represents a dramatic shift in US intervention capacity and signals weakening Sino-Russian influence in the Western Hemisphere. This challenges the multipolar order and demonstrates Trump's willingness to bypass international law, setting precedent for future interventions and destabilizing regional power dynamics.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The operation's legality under international law and its implications for the UN Charter are underexamined. Media focuses on the outcome but not on how this violates established norms that could trigger retaliatory precedents from other powers.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>China and Russia will likely increase military presence in remaining allied nations. Regional instability may spread as other US-opposed governments prepare defensive measures. Latin American nations may realign toward Beijing.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Analysis of failed Chinese military operation consequences reveals Xi Jinping's vulnerability and potential for miscalculation. Singapore's strategic role in deterrence adds critical regional dimension. This scenario planning indicates rising war probability and explores cascade effects that could reshape Indo-Pacific security architecture fundamentally.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The political consequences for Xi's regime domestically are underreported. Media focuses on military aspects but misses how domestic legitimacy crisis could trigger aggressive escalation. Singapore's leverage as deterrent is underappreciated.</p>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>China will accelerate military modernization and gray-zone operations. Taiwan will increase defense spending. Regional powers will strengthen security partnerships. Risk of accidental escalation rises significantly.</p>

                                <p>Trump's 10% tariff threat against eight NATO allies over Greenland represents unprecedented economic coercion within the alliance. This signals fundamental shift in US commitment to multilateralism and NATO cohesion. European strategic autonomy and potential realignment with non-Western powers becomes urgent necessity, destabilizing post-Cold War order.</p>

                                <p>The economic interdependence that makes these tariffs mutually destructive is underemphasized. Media misses how this accelerates European rearmament and potential independent defense capability development, reducing long-term US influence regardless of Greenland outcome.</p>

                                <p>EU will accelerate defense spending and strategic autonomy initiatives. NATO cohesion will weaken. Some allies may explore alternative security arrangements. Transatlantic trade war likely escalates through 2026.</p>

                                <p>China's shift from growth to security focus amid population decline, record trade surplus paradox, and economic inequality signals strategic reorientation toward confrontation. Fourth consecutive population decline combined with security prioritization indicates Beijing preparing for prolonged great-power competition and potential military conflict, reshaping global economic and security dynamics.</p>
