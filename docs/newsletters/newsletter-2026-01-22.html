                                <p>While deterrence gaps receive attention, the international economic and geopolitical consequences of a Taiwan conflict remain underanalyzed. This research addresses critical blind spots in war planning and could reshape how allies assess conflict scenarios and their own security commitments.</p>

                                <p>Most analysis focuses on military capability gaps rather than cascading global economic disruption, supply chain collapse, and potential NATO involvement—factors that could fundamentally alter conflict calculus for all parties.</p>

                                <p>This research will likely influence 2026 defense policy discussions, potentially leading to revised allied contingency planning and increased focus on economic resilience measures alongside military preparedness.</p>

                                <p>Trump's pivot from military threats to a negotiated 'framework' with NATO signals potential restructuring of Arctic access, NATO cohesion, and transatlantic relations. The deal's vagueness masks deeper questions about US commitment to traditional alliances and European strategic autonomy.</p>

                                <p>Media focuses on Trump's rhetoric but misses that NATO chief Rutte may have simply repackaged existing US rights as concessions, and that Europe's defensive response signals willingness to develop independent military capabilities—a historic shift.</p>

                                <p>Framework details will emerge slowly; Europe will accelerate defense spending and Arctic infrastructure development while maintaining diplomatic ambiguity to avoid antagonizing Trump further.</p>

                                <p>Direct Trump administration engagement with Putin on Ukraine through envoys Witkoff and Kushner signals potential shift toward negotiated settlement. Putin's cautious response to Trump's 'Board of Peace' proposal indicates openness but strategic calculation about terms.</p>

                                <p>Media coverage misses that Putin's willingness to meet suggests Russia may be reassessing military prospects, while Trump's vague peace framework could either accelerate negotiations or create false expectations that destabilize allied support for Ukraine.</p>

                                <p>Negotiations will likely stall on territorial concessions and NATO expansion guarantees; Trump may pressure Ukraine to accept unfavorable terms while Russia tests US commitment to European security.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Russia and China are simultaneously developing Arctic capabilities and space weapons (nuclear-armed satellites) that threaten US strategic stability. Current US space architecture and Arctic defenses are inadequate, creating vulnerability windows in two critical domains.</p>

                                <p>These threats are analyzed separately but represent coordinated great-power strategy to challenge US dominance in domains critical to global communications, navigation, and military command. Integration of Arctic and space threats requires urgent policy response.</p>

                                <p>US will accelerate space defense investments and Arctic infrastructure development; NATO will expand Arctic presence; risk of miscalculation increases if early-warning systems prove inadequate during crisis.</p>
