                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>The expiration of New START represents a historic geopolitical inflection point. This is the final nuclear arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow, removing the last institutional restraint on strategic nuclear weapons deployment. With US-Russia tensions at Cold War highs over Ukraine, this creates unprecedented nuclear instability and raises proliferation risks globally.</p>

                                <p>Media coverage often misses that this removes verification mechanisms entirely, making it impossible to monitor compliance. The timing coincides with active US-Russia peace negotiations, suggesting strategic signaling rather than genuine arms race intent, though the symbolic break is profound.</p>

                                <p>Trump administration is deploying an 'Armada' to the Persian Gulf amid Iranian military alerts and civilian evacuation preparations. This represents the most acute military flashpoint globally. Options range from naval blockades to surgical strikes on nuclear facilities. Iran's simultaneous diplomatic overtures suggest brinkmanship rather than genuine de-escalation.</p>

                                <p>Iranian civilians are actively preparing for war (sealing windows, stockpiling supplies), indicating Tehran expects conflict regardless of diplomatic talks. US military options targeting logistics infrastructure could trigger regional economic collapse affecting global oil markets. Media underplays economic consequences.</p>

                                <p>Within weeks, either a military incident triggers escalation or Trump uses military presence as leverage for nuclear negotiations. Oil prices will spike. Regional allies will face pressure to choose sides....</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>US envoy Witkoff's 'constructive' talks with Putin's economic adviser precede Abu Dhabi negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations. This represents the most serious peace effort since 2022. Timing is critical: occurring as New START expires, suggesting Trump administration is attempting diplomatic resolution before nuclear constraints vanish entirely.</p>

                                <p>The coordination between US-Russia talks and Ukraine negotiations suggests Trump may be negotiating separate bilateral deals rather than a unified settlement. Russia's participation despite military advantage indicates either genuine fatigue or strategic repositioning. Media misses that nuclear treaty collapse strengthens...</p>

                                <p>Negotiations will produce framework agreement within 60 days. Likely involves territorial concessions by Ukraine and NATO security guarantees. Russia will demand sanctions relief. Implementation will face Ukrainian domestic opposition and...</p>

                                <p>Japan-UK collaboration on critical minerals and outer space, combined with US-Philippine military drills and Chinese military patrols near Scarborough Shoal, reveals hardening alliance structures.
