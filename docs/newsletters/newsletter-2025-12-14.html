                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>As US-brokered peace negotiations intensify, Russia continues systematic strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure, killing power for over 1 million civilians. This demonstrates Russia's negotiating strategy: military pressure alongside diplomacy. European concerns about territorial guarantees and reinvasion risks suggest fundamental disagreements on ceasefire terms that could derail talks entirely.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media focuses on diplomatic progress but misses the asymmetric pressure: Russia gains negotiating leverage through infrastructure destruction while appearing open to talks. The timing suggests deliberate strategy to weaken Ukraine's position before final negotiations.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>Peace talks will likely collapse or produce weak agreements without robust security guarantees. Russia will continue infrastructure attacks to maximize territorial gains before any ceasefire takes effect.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Fundamental disagreement between US and Europe on Ukraine peace strategy threatens NATO cohesion. Europe fears Trump-backed demilitarization plan enables Russian reinvasion; US prioritizes rapid settlement. This split mirrors broader US security strategy shift away from European commitments, creating strategic vulnerability and potential for separate European-Russian negotiations.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The structural nature of this divide: it's not tactical disagreement but reflects competing visions of post-war European security. Europe's asset-freezing and financial measures suggest preparing for independent deterrence without US backing.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>EU will pursue parallel diplomatic channels with Russia independent of US negotiations. NATO unity will erode further, potentially leading to separate European security arrangements by 2026.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>New US National Security Strategy deprioritizes Southeast Asia and Europe while focusing on China containment. This creates strategic vacuums: Southeast Asia becomes bargaining chip in US-China competition; South Korea faces pressure to defend Taiwan; China tests advanced submarine drones threatening Panama Canal and US coasts. Signals fundamental shift in American global commitments.</p>

                                <p>The cascade effects: US pressure on allies to shoulder more defense burden while reducing security guarantees creates incentives for regional powers to accommodate China. Southeast Asia's absence from strategy suggests it may be sacrificed in US-China negotiations.</p>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>Southeast Asian nations will accelerate hedging strategies toward China. Taiwan security situation will deteriorate as South Korea resists deeper involvement. China's military modernization will accelerate unchecked in secondary theaters.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Three simultaneous escalations signal power vacuum: US personnel killed in Syria as Washington coordinates with Assad; Israeli strikes intensify against Hamas leadership; UN peacekeepers killed in Sudan by RSF. These conflicts intensify as US-Europe focus narrows to Ukraine and China. Regional actors exploit reduced great power attention to pursue territorial and political objectives.</p>

                                <p>The coordination between these escalations suggests regional actors testing Western resolve. Sudan's RSF, Hamas, and ISIS operate with reduced external pressure as global attention concentrates elsewhere. This creates cascading instability across Middle East and Africa.</p>
