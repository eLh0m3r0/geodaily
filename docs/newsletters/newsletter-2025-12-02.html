                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Steve Witkoff's Moscow visit represents a critical diplomatic inflection point in the Ukraine conflict. Trump's direct engagement with Putin signals potential major shifts in US foreign policy and could reshape European security architecture. This bilateral channel bypasses traditional diplomatic protocols and NATO structures.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The concerning precedent of dealmakers replacing career diplomats in high-stakes negotiations. Witkoff's business background raises questions about whether commercial interests might influence security outcomes, particularly regarding territorial concessions and NATO membership terms.</p>

                                <p>Expect significant pressure on Zelensky to accept territorial compromises within weeks. European allies will likely increase diplomatic activity to ensure their interests aren't sidelined in bilateral US-Russia negotiations.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>France and Ukraine are actively mobilizing European diplomatic support to prevent exclusion from Ukraine peace negotiations. This represents a critical power struggle between European interests and Trump's bilateral US-Russia approach. The outcome will determine Europe's strategic autonomy and influence over post-war security arrangements.</p>

                                <p>The underlying fracture within Europe itself: Belgium's resistance to using Russian assets for Ukraine reconstruction signals potential EU cohesion breakdown. European unity on Ukraine policy is more fragile than public statements suggest, creating opportunities for Russian divide-and-conquer tactics.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Expect a formal European peace proposal within two weeks attempting to establish a unified negotiating position. However, internal EU disagreements will likely limit its effectiveness against US-Russia bilateral talks.</p>

                                <p>North Korea's weapons showcase and pursuit of Russian fighter jets signals deepening Russia-North Korea military integration amid Ukraine war. This creates a new strategic axis that could destabilize East Asia, particularly threatening Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Japan's missile exports to Philippines represent counter-balancing but risk escalation.</p>

                                <p>Trump's expanded military operations against Venezuela represent a significant escalation in US interventionism. The administration is moving from sanctions to direct military action, raising serious questions about international law, regional stability, and potential humanitarian consequences.
