                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Historic first trilateral negotiations between US, Russia, and Ukraine represent a critical diplomatic breakthrough. Trump's envoys met Putin overnight, with territorial disputes emerging as central to settlement. Abu Dhabi talks mark potential turning point in 4-year conflict affecting global security, energy markets, and NATO cohesion.</p>

                                <p>Media focuses on diplomatic theater but misses that territorial concessions likely required from Ukraine. Putin's insistence on territorial resolution suggests Russia maintains negotiating leverage despite military stalemate. Zelensky's security guarantee agreement with Trump may constrain Ukraine's negotiating position.</p>

                                <p>Talks will reveal fundamental gap between Russian territorial demands and Ukrainian/Western red lines. Expect framework agreement within weeks but implementation deadlock. Potential frozen conflict scenario emerges if compromise found on...</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Taiwan faces dual crisis: domestic opposition blocking defense spending while China deploys unprecedented drone operations in claimed airspace. First confirmed PLA drone flight over Pratas Island signals new 'salami-slicing' strategy. Opposition gridlock weakens Taiwan's military readiness precisely when Chinese pressure intensifies, creating dangerous vulnerability window.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Taiwan's internal political divisions are as threatening as external military pressure. Opposition parties' defense spending resistance reflects deeper societal ambivalence about confrontation with China. China's drone deployment designed to test Taiwan's response capacity and degrade military morale through attrition tactics.</p>

                                <p>Taiwan defense spending will eventually pass but with delays reducing military modernization timeline. China will conduct repeated drone incursions to normalize presence and wear down Taiwan's air defense resources. Cross-strait...</p>

                                <p>Zelensky's blistering Davos critique of European fragmentation and Trump-dependency exposes fundamental NATO crisis. European leaders simultaneously relieved by Greenland tensions easing yet terrified of future Trump actions.

                                <p>Greenland crisis was symptom, not cause. Deeper issue is Europe's strategic paralysis and inability to develop independent deterrence capability against Russia. Trump's threats exposed that European defense spending increases remain insufficient and politically fragile. NATO unity depends entirely on US...</p>

                                <p>Europe will accelerate defense spending and strategic autonomy initiatives but progress will be slow and incomplete. Further Trump provocations will deepen transatlantic rift. France and Germany may pursue independent Russia...</p>

                                <p>China dominates rare earth supply chain while advancing AI chip technology with superior energy efficiency.
