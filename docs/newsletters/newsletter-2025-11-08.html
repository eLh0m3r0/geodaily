                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Trump's decision to exempt Hungary from Russian oil sanctions represents a fundamental shift in US enforcement of Russia policy. This undermines Western sanctions coordination, rewards a NATO ally for maintaining Russian ties, and signals Trump's willingness to prioritize bilateral relationships over collective security frameworks during the Ukraine conflict.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media focuses on Orban's political win but misses the cascading effect: other NATO members may now demand similar exemptions, weakening sanctions effectiveness against Russia's war economy and creating precedent for sanctions carve-outs based on political alignment rather than strategic necessity.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Other EU members will likely request exemptions within weeks. Russia's oil revenue will stabilize, reducing pressure for negotiated settlement. EU cohesion on Russia policy will deteriorate, forcing Brussels to choose...</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>UN, US, and UK removal of sanctions on Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa before his White House visit signals dramatic diplomatic rehabilitation. This represents potential realignment in Middle East policy, with implications for Israel-Syria relations, Kurdish autonomy, and US regional strategy post-ISIS.</p>

                                <p>Timing suggests coordinated Western strategy to engage Syria's new leadership, but articles underreport Israel's lobbying to maintain Caesar sanctions and the unresolved question of Syrian government legitimacy. This could reshape Levantine geopolitics without addressing underlying governance issues.</p>

                                <p>Sharaa will likely secure additional sanctions relief during White House meeting. US may establish military-to-military ties with Damascus. Israel will face pressure to normalize relations or risk isolation. Regional balance...</p>

                                <p>Taiwan's Vice President addresses European Parliament despite Beijing protests while India faces pressure from US sanctions on Russian oil. These parallel stories reveal China's expanding assertiveness and US efforts to consolidate alliances, creating strategic dilemmas for middle powers navigating great power competition.</p>

                                <p>Coverage misses the coordinated nature of China's pushback (diplomatic protests, sanctions threats) and how US sanctions policy inadvertently pushes India closer to China. The Taiwan-Europe engagement signals growing democratic coalition-building, but sustainability depends on US commitment amid Trump's transactional approach.</p>

                                <p>Ukraine's successful campaign against Russian oil infrastructure combined with US backing for EU use of frozen Russian assets represents new sanctions paradigm.
