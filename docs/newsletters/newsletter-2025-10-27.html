                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Days before Xi-Jinping and Trump meet, both nations agreed on a trade deal framework. This represents the most significant diplomatic breakthrough in US-China relations in months, with potential to reshape global trade dynamics and reduce economic uncertainty affecting worldwide markets and supply chains.</p>

                                <p>The agreement's specifics on enforcement mechanisms and timeline remain unclear. Media focus on tariff rollback obscures deeper structural issues in bilateral trade imbalances and intellectual property disputes that may resurface.</p>

                                <p>Trump and Xi will likely announce formal tariff reductions at their upcoming meeting. However, disagreements over rare earth controls and technology restrictions will persist, limiting the deal's comprehensiveness.</p>

                                <p>Trump administration escalates sanctions targeting Russian oil revenues while simultaneously pursuing peace negotiations. This dual-track approach exposes critical fractures in Russia's war economy, creating leverage for Ukraine negotiations while testing whether economic pressure can force diplomatic concessions.</p>

                                <p>Analysis underestimates Russia's adaptation capacity and alternative revenue sources. The Kremlin's willingness to engage despite sanctions suggests Moscow believes it can sustain current military operations regardless of economic pressure, complicating Trump's negotiating position.</p>

                                <p>First commercial flights between India and China since 2020 border tensions signal cautious diplomatic thaw between Asia's two most populous nations.

                                <p>Flight resumption masks unresolved border tensions and military buildups.

                                <p>Russia claims successful test of unlimited-range nuclear-powered cruise missile, escalating military capabilities during active Ukraine conflict. If operational, this weapon fundamentally alters strategic balance by potentially bypassing NATO air defenses, raising nuclear escalation risks and complicating deterrence calculations.</p>

                                <p>Western experts question the missile's actual operational viability and reliability. Russian claims may be exaggerated for psychological effect.
