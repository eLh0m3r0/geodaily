                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Trump's directive to resume US nuclear weapons testing marks a dramatic escalation in great power competition. This reverses three decades of restraint, directly responding to Russian and Chinese nuclear developments. It signals abandonment of arms control norms and risks triggering a new nuclear arms race with unpredictable consequences for global stability.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The timing—announced minutes before Trump-Xi meeting—suggests deliberate signaling to China. Media focuses on the announcement but misses implications for New START treaty viability and how this undermines US negotiating position on Ukraine and trade simultaneously.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>China and Russia will likely accelerate their own nuclear programs. New START treaty collapse becomes probable. This could trigger NATO nuclear posture reviews and destabilize arms control architecture for decades.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Trump-Xi summit represents critical inflection point for US-China relations with direct implications for Taiwan, Ukraine, and global trade. Trump's stated willingness to have China help broker Ukraine peace while discussing Taiwan and trade creates complex leverage dynamics. Outcomes will reshape Indo-Pacific security architecture and European conflict resolution.</p>

                                <p>Democrats' warning about security restrictions (article 22) reveals internal US divisions on China policy. Media misses that Trump may be trading Taiwan security guarantees for China's Ukraine mediation—a potential strategic realignment with massive implications for US alliance system.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>Expect framework agreement on Ukraine mediation with ambiguous Taiwan language. Trade deal likely includes security concessions. This could fracture US-Japan-South Korea coordination and embolden China regionally.</p>

                                <p>Russia's strategic energy coercion against Ukraine and Europe has fundamentally failed due to EU sanctions, renewable transition, and Ukrainian infrastructure resilience. Simultaneously, EU is preparing military mobility protocols for potential Russian aggression beyond Ukraine. This represents strategic defeat for Putin's hybrid warfare doctrine and European security reorientation.</p>

                                <p>Analysis misses that Russia's energy vulnerability now exceeds its leverage. EU tank mobility protocols (article 4) indicate NATO preparing for conventional conflict scenario—not deterrence posture but operational readiness. This represents quiet but profound NATO militarization.</p>

                                <p>Russia will intensify kinetic operations as hybrid leverage fails. EU will accelerate military spending and integration. Energy prices may spike but won't break Western resolve. Long-term: European strategic autonomy increases,...</p>

                                <p>Putin's public demonstrations of nuclear-powered cruise missiles and underwater drones represent deliberate strategic messaging during Trump-Xi summit. These weapons—Burevestnik and Poseidon—are designed for strategic deterrence and signal Russia's commitment to nuclear modernization despite sanctions. This directly counters Western military support for Ukraine and tests NATO resolve.</p>

                                <p>Media treats weapons tests as separate events but misses coordinated messaging strategy. Putin timing announcements during Trump-Xi meeting to influence negotiations. These weapons are largely theoretical/developmental—focus on propaganda value over operational capability. Real message: Russia won't negotiate from weakness.</p>
