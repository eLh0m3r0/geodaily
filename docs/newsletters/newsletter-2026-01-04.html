                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>US military operation capturing Venezuelan President Maduro marks unprecedented direct intervention in Latin America under Trump. This fundamentally reshapes regional power dynamics, challenges post-WWII international law norms, and signals aggressive unilateral US foreign policy. Global backlash indicates potential realignment of international coalitions and precedent for future interventions.</p>

                                <p>Media focuses on Maduro's capture but underreports Trump's explicit claim to 'run Venezuela' and control oil reserves—essentially announcing neocolonial governance. The operation's legality under international law and its implications for UN authority remain underdiscussed. Cuban and Russian responses could trigger...</p>

                                <p>North Korea's ballistic missile launches coincide with South Korean president's China visit, signaling coordinated pressure on Seoul and potential China-NK alignment.

                                <p>Zelenskyy's appointment of military intelligence chief as security advisor signals preparation for major security guarantee negotiations. This institutional restructuring suggests Ukraine anticipating significant diplomatic shifts regarding NATO membership, territorial concessions, or security architecture.

                                <p>Venezuela experienced largest peacetime economic contraction in modern history; simultaneous Iran nationwide protests indicate broader authoritarian governance failures across US adversary states.
