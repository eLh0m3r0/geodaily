                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>US-brokered Ukraine-Russia negotiations in Abu Dhabi represent the most significant diplomatic effort to end the four-year conflict. Russia's simultaneous attacks on energy infrastructure demonstrate the fragility of any agreement and test whether diplomatic channels can survive military escalation during negotiations.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media focuses on talk schedules but misses that Russia's winter energy attacks signal Moscow may be maximizing leverage before negotiations conclude, suggesting Moscow views talks as tactical rather than strategic commitment to peace.</p>

                                <p>Talks will likely produce framework agreements on territorial issues, but implementation will depend on NATO troop deployment guarantees and verification mechanisms that remain contentious between parties.</p>

                                <p>The February 5 expiration of the last US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty removes constraints on strategic weapons. China's refusal to join trilateral negotiations creates a three-way nuclear competition with no guardrails, fundamentally altering global security architecture and increasing miscalculation risks.</p>

                                <p>Analysis typically focuses on US-Russia dynamics but misses that China's military purges and strategic ambiguity suggest Beijing is preparing for unconstrained nuclear modernization while maintaining strategic ambiguity about Taiwan intentions.</p>

                                <p>Without New START renewal, expect accelerated Russian and Chinese nuclear deployments, increased US military spending, and potential regional nuclear proliferation as non-aligned states pursue deterrents amid great power competition.</p>

                                <p>Removal of top PLA generals Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli indicates Xi prioritizes military restructuring over immediate Taiwan action. This suggests Beijing believes internal military modernization is more urgent than cross-strait military operations, fundamentally reshaping timeline for potential Taiwan conflict.</p>

                                <p>Western analysis frames purges as corruption crackdowns, but Chinese military analysts interpret this as strategic assessment that Taiwan issue can wait while PLA undergoes generational modernization and loyalty consolidation under Xi's direct control.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Resumption of US-Iran nuclear negotiations occurs simultaneously with US military interception of Iranian drones near carrier strike groups, creating dangerous parallel tracks. This dual approach—diplomacy and military posturing—risks miscalculation while offering potential de-escalation pathway in volatile Middle East.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Media treats talks and military incidents separately, but Iran's venue demands (Oman instead of Turkey) and drone incidents suggest Tehran is testing US resolve and establishing negotiating leverage through military signaling rather than genuine escalation.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Talks will likely produce interim confidence-building measures on nuclear monitoring, but without broader regional security framework addressing Gulf tensions, military incidents will continue undermining diplomatic progress.</p>
