                                <p>Japan's new PM Sanae Takaichi signaled potential military intervention in Taiwan, prompting China to warn citizens against travel and threaten retaliation. This represents a significant shift in Japan's security posture and directly challenges China's core interests, escalating tensions in the Indo-Pacific's most critical flashpoint.</p>

                                <p>The underlying concern about Japan potentially abandoning its non-nuclear policy amid this crisis. China's warnings suggest Beijing fears Tokyo may weaponize its military capabilities more aggressively, fundamentally altering regional security dynamics beyond the immediate Taiwan dispute.</p>

                                <p>China is leveraging advanced nuclear reactor technology and renewable energy dominance to expand geopolitical influence across Southeast Asia.

                                <p>Russia is conducting unprecedented attacks on Ukraine's rail and energy infrastructure, with over 400 drones and missiles striking Kyiv in recent days.
