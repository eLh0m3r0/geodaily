                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Trump's directive to resume nuclear weapons testing signals potential withdrawal from nonproliferation norms. Energy Secretary clarified tests won't involve explosions, but the policy shift threatens strategic stability with Russia and China, potentially triggering reciprocal escalation and destabilizing global security architecture established post-Cold War.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The distinction between subcritical experiments and full testing obscures the real concern: normalization of nuclear weapons development as policy tool. This reverses decades of arms control consensus and may embolden other nuclear powers to pursue similar programs.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Russia and China will likely announce their own nuclear modernization programs within weeks. International nonproliferation treaties face pressure. Strategic stability talks between superpowers become urgent diplomatic priority.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Trump claims Xi assured him China won't attack Taiwan during his presidency. This extraordinary diplomatic claim, if accurate, represents major geopolitical realignment. However, vagueness about US defense commitment and reliance on personal assurances creates dangerous ambiguity that could miscalculate during crisis, destabilizing Indo-Pacific security.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Trump's refusal to explicitly commit to Taiwan defense while claiming Chinese assurances suggests potential transactional approach to alliance commitments. This undermines deterrence credibility and may encourage Chinese miscalculation about US resolve.</p>

                                <p>Taiwan will seek clarification on US defense guarantees. China may test boundaries of agreement. Regional allies (Japan, South Korea) will demand explicit security reassurances from Washington within months.</p>

                                <p>Ukraine systematically strikes Russian energy infrastructure and oil terminals, degrading Russia's war economy. Recent Tuapse attack damaged vessels and facilities. This strategy aims to undermine Russian military logistics and economic capacity. Escalating drone warfare on energy targets represents new phase of conflict with economic warfare dimensions.</p>

                                <p>Ukraine's drone campaign's effectiveness in degrading Russian military-industrial capacity receives less attention than kinetic battlefield operations. This asymmetric strategy may prove more consequential for war outcome than conventional fighting, forcing Russia into costly reconstruction efforts.</p>

                                <p>China's updated sixth-generation fighter prototypes demonstrate rapid technological advancement in military aviation. Rapid iteration (10 months between appearances) suggests accelerated development timeline.
