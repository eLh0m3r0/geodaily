                                <p>Three nuclear or near-nuclear adversaries are deepening strategic partnerships while challenging international non-proliferation frameworks. North Korea gains leverage in Trump negotiations, Iran abandons IAEA cooperation, and Russia-Iran military ties expand. This represents a fundamental shift in global security architecture with implications for US allies worldwide.</p>

                                <p>The coordination between these three actors suggests a unified strategy to undermine Western-led international order. Iran's rejection of IAEA cooperation isn't isolated—it's synchronized with North Korea's negotiating position and Russia's war economy needs. This axis threatens multiple regions simultaneously.</p>

                                <p>China's rare earth export controls have triggered G7/EU counter-measures, but analysis reveals Beijing has already won this competition structurally. With 29% plunge in US rare earth magnet imports and China controlling refinery technology, Western efforts to diversify are years behind. This affects military production, EV manufacturing, and semiconductor capabilities globally.</p>

                                <p>The rare earths battle isn't about current shortages—it's about China's irreversible technological and infrastructure dominance. Western price floor strategies won't work because China controls the entire supply chain vertically. This represents a permanent shift in technological leverage.</p>

                                <p>A planned Trump-Putin summit in Budapest is proceeding while Zelensky seeks inclusion and reportedly rejects territorial concessions. Trump downplays China's Taiwan threat and suggests Ukraine cannot win militarily. This signals potential US withdrawal from Ukraine support, threatening European security architecture and NATO credibility. EU concerns about being sidelined are mounting.</p>

                                <p>Trump's simultaneous downplaying of Taiwan threats while negotiating with Putin suggests a broader strategy of reducing US security commitments globally.

                                <p>China increases Russian oil imports despite US pressure, yuan settlements expand in emerging markets, and Hong Kong stocks rally on trade deal hopes—yet underlying data shows structural decoupling.

                                <p>Market optimism about US-China trade deals masks deeper structural shifts. China's yuan settlement expansion and Russian energy integration aren't temporary—they're building a parallel economic system.
