                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>The expiration of New START represents the first time since 1972 that US-Russia lack nuclear weapons limits. Trump's rejection of extension and call for trilateral US-China-Russia deal creates unprecedented strategic uncertainty. This fundamentally reshapes global nuclear deterrence architecture and increases proliferation risks across multiple regions including Korea and Middle East.</p>

                                <p>Media focuses on treaty mechanics but misses how expiration emboldens North Korea and complicates Iran negotiations. The absence of verification mechanisms removes transparency that prevented miscalculation during Cold War tensions. China's refusal to participate in trilateral talks signals Beijing's strategic...</p>

                                <p>After 4+ years without high-level military contact, US-Russia reestablish dialogue following Trump-brokered Ukraine talks in Abu Dhabi. Prisoner exchanges and trilateral negotiations signal potential ceasefire framework. This represents fundamental shift from Biden's containment approach, with Trump envoy Witkoff describing talks as 'productive.' European security architecture hangs in balance.</p>

Talks in Oman address Tehran's nuclear program amid domestic unrest and sanctions. Iran's 'bullish' posture suggests belief Trump lacks regime-change plan.

                                <p>Articles detail how Japan and South Korea position as critical logistics and military support bases for potential Taiwan conflict. Japan's role as 'deterrence logistics hub' and USFK's Taiwan war contingency planning reveal concrete military preparations. China's failed diplomatic campaign against Japan signals Beijing's concern about encirclement. These logistics networks determine conflict outcome and regional power balance.</p>
