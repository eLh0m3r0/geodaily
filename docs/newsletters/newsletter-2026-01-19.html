                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Trump's demand to acquire Greenland, backed by tariff threats against NATO allies, represents an unprecedented challenge to the transatlantic alliance. The EU is considering retaliatory measures while UK and European leaders scramble diplomatically. This threatens NATO's cohesion at a critical geopolitical moment.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>The economic interdependence between US and Europe means both sides face severe costs from escalation. Greenland's strategic Arctic position matters less than the precedent of coercive territorial demands within the Western alliance, signaling potential instability in other alliance relationships.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>China achieved 5% GDP growth in 2025 despite US trade war, but Q4 slowed to 3-year low (4.5%). Property sector continues declining, raising questions about sustainability. This matters because China's economic trajectory directly impacts global trade, supply chains, and geopolitical competition with the US.</p>

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Official statistics mask deeper structural problems: property collapse, weak domestic consumption, and reliance on government stimulus. The gap between headline growth and underlying economic health suggests China may struggle to fund military modernization and technological competition with the US long-term.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>What to Watch</h3>
                                <p>China will likely increase stimulus spending and accelerate technological self-reliance initiatives. Property sector stabilization will remain elusive, forcing reallocation of capital toward strategic industries like semiconductors, AI, and green energy.</p>

                                <p>China developed world-class ion implanter technology while recruiting leading quantum physicist from US. These parallel developments show China's strategy to break semiconductor supply chain dependencies and attract diaspora talent.

                                <p>The brain drain component is underreported: top scientists leaving US research institutions for Chinese positions suggests China's technological trajectory may accelerate faster than Western assessments assume. This indicates potential failure of US talent retention strategies amid geopolitical competition.</p>

                                <p>Trump's kidnapping of Maduro and intervention in Venezuela has humiliated Russia and China, forcing them to recalibrate Latin American strategy. Simultaneously, US pressure forced Syrian Kurds to cede territory to Damascus. These actions signal US willingness to unilaterally reshape regional orders, challenging rival influence.</p>

                                <p>The coordinated nature of US interventions across regions suggests a broader strategy to roll back Russian and Chinese influence simultaneously.
