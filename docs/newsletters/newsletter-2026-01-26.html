                                <p>Expiration of US-Russia nuclear treaty combined with three convergent factors is pushing Northeast Asia toward unprecedented nuclear tension. This threatens regional stability involving US, Russia, China, and allied nations with direct implications for global security architecture and deterrence frameworks.</p>

                                <p>Analysis often focuses on bilateral US-Russia dynamics but misses how Northeast Asian powers (Japan, South Korea, North Korea) are independently accelerating nuclear programs in response to regional instability rather than just copying superpowers.</p>

                                <p>Expect accelerated nuclear weapons development by Japan and South Korea, potential North Korean provocations, and breakdown of remaining arms control agreements within 12-18 months.</p>

                                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                                <p>Investigation of Zhang Youxia, China's second-ranking general and Xi's closest military ally, represents highest-profile purge since Cultural Revolution.

                                <h3>What Others Are Missing</h3>
                                <p>Western analysis treats this as routine anti-corruption but misses the unprecedented scale of simultaneous purges of top-tier generals, suggesting deeper factional conflict or security threats Xi fears within military hierarchy itself.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Further military leadership changes likely; potential reshuffling of command structures and military region assignments within weeks. May indicate Xi preparing for major policy shifts or responding to internal military opposition.</p>

                                <p>Media focuses on document completion but underreports that simultaneous DMZ discussions suggest territorial concessions may be on table. The timing of these parallel negotiations indicates major shift in Ukrainian negotiating position or US pressure for settlement.</p>

                                <p>Security guarantee document likely signed within 2-4 weeks; formal peace negotiations with territorial framework could begin within 30 days if momentum continues.</p>

                                <p>US Treasury Secretary and Trump threaten punitive tariffs if Canada pursues trade agreement with China.

                                <p>Coverage misses this as test case for Trump's broader strategy of forcing allied nations to choose between US and China economically. Sets precedent for similar pressure on other allies and indicates breakdown of traditional alliance economic frameworks.</p>
